# "The Litre" build log

2020-11-07

I'm starting the log to hopefully make it a new tradition for those projects. So far, I've ordered a few parts, which I've added to the readme.

I found a number of interesting resources so far for the build. The most notable one is the ["Veronica" PC](https://blondihacks.com/veronica-cpu-board/), done almost exactly like I wanted to, also utilizing a passive backplane with 8-bit ISA slots.
